What is grown on the Campus Garden?

In mid-to-late spring, the garden focus on summer crops such as eggplant, tomatoes, squash, watermelon, and strawberries. In the fall, mostly leafy plants that can withstand the unpredictable weather patterns of the fall and early winter months are planted.

Where does the produce go?

A portion of the produce grown at the Campus Garden is distributed to families in need in the community through our partner organization, Campus Kitchen. Campus Kitchen at Wake Forest University is part of a growing network of university organizations called The Campus Kitchens Project. Each school affiliated with CKP operates a little differently, but they all have the common goal of reducing food waste in their university and community, as well as, combating food insecurity by addressing its root causes. Additionally, garden volunteers are welcome to enjoy the organic produce.
